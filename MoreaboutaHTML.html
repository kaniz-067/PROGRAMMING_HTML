Box Model Properties:
   - The CSS box model is used for layout and design of elements.
   - It consists of the following areas:
       - `Content`: The actual content inside the box.
       - `Padding`: Clears an area around the content, inside the border.
       - `Border`: A line that wraps around the padding and content.
       - `Margin`: Clears space outside the border, separating the element from others.

Padding:
   - The space between the content and the border of an element.
   - Can be set individually for each side:
       - `padding-top`, `padding-right`, `padding-bottom`, `padding-left`.
   - Example: 
       - `padding: 10px;` (applies to all sides equally).
       - `padding: 10px 20px;` (10px top/bottom, 20px left/right).

Border:
 - A line around the padding (or content if no padding is set).
   - Border properties:
       - `border-width`: Thickness of the border (e.g., `2px`).
       - `border-style`: Style of the border (e.g., `solid`, `dashed`, `none`).
       - `border-color`: Color of the border (e.g., `#333` or `red`).
   - Example:
       - `border: 2px solid black;`

Margin:
   - The space outside the border, separating the element from others.
   - Can be set individually for each side:
       - `margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom`, `margin-left`.
   - Example:
       - `margin: 10px;` (applies to all sides equally).
       - `margin: 10px 20px;` (10px top/bottom, 20px left/right).

Height and Width:
   - Specifies the dimensions of an element's content area.
    - Can be set in various units (e.g., `px`, `%`, `em`, `vh`, `vw`).
   - Default behavior:
       - Block-level elements expand to fill the available width.
       - Inline elements take up only as much width as their content.


Block vs Inline Elements:
   - Block Elements:
       - Start on a new line and take up the full width available.
       - Examples: `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<section>`.
       - Can contain other block or inline elements.
   - Inline Elements:
       - Do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
       - Examples: `<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`.
       - Cannot contain block-level elements.
